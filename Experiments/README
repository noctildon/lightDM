flux_mA1MeV_ePHe and flux_mA50MeV_ePHe (from Jong-Chul) are WIMP flux [cm^-2 s^-1 MeV^-1] dPhi/dE

# CCM200
 - use "TBrowser tb" in ROOT to save the root file in .c, then extract the points
 - old is the 1st root file from Mayank
 - CCM bkg.csv and CCM bkg energy edges.csv is the 2nd root file from Mayank (DM_inelastic_cuts.root)

# PIP2BD
 - uses the 2GeV beam on shielded target
 - columns goes like px, py, pz, E, x, y, z, t
    p/E are in GeV, xyz in meter, t in second
 - 1e7 POT total stimulated
 - 4.95e23 POT total
 - 5 years runtime
 - 100t LAr detector
 - distance 15 or 30 meter


# BNB
 - columns: px, py, pz, T [GeV]
 - T is kinetic energy
