beamExposure:
  name: Beam exposure
  value: 7.47594
  units: GW*hr
  uncertainty: negligible
  comment: |
    This is the effective SNS beam exposure for the Chicago analysis of the first result from the COHERENT Collaboration.
    This represents the effective exposure for the data released here, and is reflective of the result from the 2017 Science publication.

distanceToTarget:
  name: Distance to target
  value: 19.3
  units: m
  uncertainty: negligible
  comment: |
    This value was determined from a LIDAR scan of the neutrino alley target area carried out by the survey and alignment team of the SNS.

csiQF:
  name: CsI-Na quenching factor
  value: 0.0878
  units: none
  uncertainty: 0.0166
  comment: |
    This value for the QF was determined based on a fit to all available data points, including those from COHERENT measurements and others from literature.
    A weighted average between 5 and 30 keVnr determined the mean value, while the uncertainty was defined by the unweighted standard deviation of these points.
    To convert nuclear-recoil energy X into electron-equivalent energy, multiply X by the quenching factor.

csiLightYield:
  name: Light yield for CsI-Na
  value: 13.348
  units: PE/keVee
  uncertainty: 0.019
  comment: |
    Light yield for CsI-Na detector measured at 59.54 keV 241Am line.
    This is the average of several measurements made along the length of the detector.
    
neutrinosPerProton:
  name: Neutrinos produced per SNS proton
  value: 0.08
  uncertainty: 0.008
  units: nu/flavor/proton
  comment: |
    This is the number of decay-at-rest neutrinos produced per incident SNS beam proton per neutrino flavor.
    The DAR neutrinos are emitted isotropically.

promptNeutronNormalization:
  name: Normalization constant of prompt neutron PDF
  value: 1
  uncertainty: 0.25
  units: none
  comment: |
    The PDF included is normalized so that bin values represent the number of counts expected per GW-hr of SNS beam exposure.
    After scaling for exposure, the overall uncertainty of the normalization on the prompt PDF is 25 percent.

    Analysis efficiency is described by f(x) = a/(1.0 + exp(-k*(x - x_0))) * H(x-5)
    Where H(x) denotes a modified Heaviside step function and the parameter values are included here, along with asymmetric, 1-sigma errors.
    H(x) has a value of 0 for x < 5; a value of 1/2 for 5 <= x < 6; and a value of 1 for x >= 6.
    This efficiency must be applied to any calculated CEvNS recoil curves, as well as the prompt-neutron distribution, before the distributions are compared with data.
    It is applied to distributions binned with 1-PE bin widths, and the effective efficiency value for each bin is taken as the value of this function at the bin center (e.g., evaluated at 0.5 for the 1-PE bin, evaluated at 1.5 for the 2-PE bin, etc).
